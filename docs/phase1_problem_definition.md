# Phase 1: Problem Definition and Requirements

## Problem Statement

### Core Problem
Healthcare professionals and researchers struggle to efficiently extract meaningful insights from complex clinical databases due to:
- **Technical Barriers**: SQL knowledge requirements limiting access to valuable data
- **Time Constraints**: Manual query writing is time-consuming in fast-paced clinical environments
- **Data Complexity**: Clinical databases contain intricate relationships and domain-specific terminology
- **User Experience Gap**: Disconnect between natural clinical questions and technical query language

### Target Problem Space
1. **Clinical Decision Support**: Rapid access to patient data patterns for treatment decisions
2. **Research Analytics**: Streamlined data exploration for clinical research studies
3. **Quality Improvement**: Easy access to metrics for healthcare quality initiatives
4. **Educational Tools**: Learning platform for medical students and residents

## Natural Language Query (NLQ) Fundamentals

### What is NLQ?
Natural Language Query processing enables users to interact with databases using everyday language instead of formal query languages like SQL. In the clinical context, this means converting questions like:

**Natural Language**: "Show me patients with diabetes who had heart attacks in the last year"
**Generated SQL**: 
```sql
SELECT p.patient_id, p.name, d1.diagnosis_date as diabetes_date, d2.diagnosis_date as mi_date
FROM patients p
JOIN diagnoses d1 ON p.patient_id = d1.patient_id
JOIN diagnoses d2 ON p.patient_id = d2.patient_id
WHERE d1.icd10_code LIKE 'E11%' -- Type 2 Diabetes
  AND d2.icd10_code IN ('I21.0', 'I21.1', 'I21.2', 'I21.3') -- Myocardial Infarction
  AND d2.diagnosis_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year';
```

### NLQ Challenges in Clinical Domain
1. **Medical Terminology**: Complex medical terms and abbreviations
2. **Temporal Reasoning**: Time-based queries (before, after, during treatment)
3. **Clinical Relationships**: Understanding patient-provider-treatment relationships
4. **Data Standardization**: Multiple coding systems (ICD-10, CPT, SNOMED-CT)
5. **Privacy & Security**: HIPAA compliance and data protection requirements

## Clinical Data Standards Overview

### FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)
- **Purpose**: Modern standard for health information exchange
- **Structure**: RESTful API with JSON/XML format
- **Key Resources**: Patient, Encounter, Observation, Medication, Condition
- **Benefits**: Interoperability, modern web standards, growing adoption

### HL7 (Health Level Seven)
- **HL7 v2**: Legacy messaging standard, widely used
- **HL7 v3**: Complex, XML-based, limited adoption
- **CDA (Clinical Document Architecture)**: Document-based standard
- **Integration**: Often requires transformation for database storage

### Common Clinical Coding Systems
1. **ICD-10**: International Classification of Diseases (diagnoses)
2. **CPT**: Current Procedural Terminology (procedures)
3. **SNOMED-CT**: Comprehensive clinical terminology
4. **LOINC**: Laboratory and clinical observations
5. **RxNorm**: Medication normalization

## Electronic Health Record (EHR) Integration Needs

### Common EHR Systems
- **Epic**: Large health systems, complex data model
- **Cerner**: Hospital-focused, Oracle-based
- **AllScripts**: Ambulatory care focus
- **athenahealth**: Cloud-based, practice management

### Integration Challenges
1. **Data Export**: Limited API access, batch exports
2. **Schema Variations**: Different table structures across systems
3. **Real-time vs Batch**: Performance and freshness trade-offs
4. **Data Quality**: Inconsistent data entry and missing values

### EHR Data Types for NLQ
- **Structured Data**: Demographics, lab values, vital signs
- **Semi-structured**: Clinical notes with coded elements
- **Unstructured**: Free-text clinical narratives
- **Time-series**: Continuous monitoring data
